Design Notes
============
* temple location set at beginning of game
* to win, bring enough gold to temple location
* start at cities of refuge (CoR)
* about 30 min to play
* playable by 2-6
* get gold by conquering cities
* spend gold by moving/attacking
* use single die for randomization
* if a region is conquered, player gets bonus

Player Turn
-----------
* move, paying provision fee of 1 gold/army
* attack, take difference between city defense and number of armies; if roll is over this difference, conquered, if tied, nothing, if lower, lose something
* roll for CoR, transport to a CoR, or if at one, roll to get gold

Includes
--------
* map board
* city tokens
    * one temple token
    * six CoR numbered tokens (in red)
    * remaining city tokens with numbers from 1-9

Expansions
==========
* tokens for cities that determine strength, resources, etc
* once you defeat a city, take gold and reduce its power
* surrounding territories come into play
* _Divided Kingdom_

Other ideas
===========
* bank gold at CoR
* bonus gold for trivia
